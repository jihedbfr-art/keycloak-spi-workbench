# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains Keycloak SPI providers — authenticators, event listeners and federation providers — that are meant to be built and deployed into a real Keycloak server. A flaw here can affect authentication on any server running these providers, so security reports on this code are taken seriously.

## Supported versions

Only the `main` branch is maintained. Check the Keycloak version declared in `pom.xml` before reporting — an issue fixed upstream in a newer Keycloak may still be present here.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue, and do not send email.** A public issue tells everyone
about the problem before there is a fix.

Report it through GitHub Security Advisories, which keeps the report private until a
fix is ready:

1. Open the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Go to **Advisories**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.

A useful report says what the flaw is, how to reproduce it, and what an attacker gets
out of it. A proof of concept helps more than a description.

## What to expect

This repository is maintained by one person, so treat the timeline accordingly: an
acknowledgement within a week, and an honest answer about whether the issue will be
fixed, rather than silence. If a fix is accepted, disclosure is coordinated with you.

If a report turns out not to be a vulnerability, you will be told why.
